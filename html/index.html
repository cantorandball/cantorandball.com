                <p>We help with all stages of software design and development. From generating, researching and validating ideas, through implementing the product or service, and launching it to your users. We start with wherever you’re at and we’re focused on ensuring that your money isn’t spent building the wrong thing.</p>
                <p>We’re ready to help you discover the right thing to build or get a team together to deliver it. But, if you’re not sure exactly where you are or what you need, then our one­day Canvas session will help paint a clear picture.</p>

                <p>We help organisations of all shapes and sizes get the most from their people, processes and technology. Whether it’s just a quick external opinion on a specific area, some help with due diligence, or a <span class="italic">complete organisational re-design and transformation</span>, we can help.</p>
                <p>We can help clarify your business strategy, organise your product portfolio, <span class="italic">capabilities</span> and processes, or simply provide mentoring and training services.</p>
                <p>Let’s start with where you’re at. If you’re not sure what to review or how to investigate, our one-day <span class="italic">Spotlight</span> session will help bring clarity to the field of view.</p>

            <div class="text col-md-12">
                <p>Ideas for social good can come from anywhere. We enjoy helping others to join the technology dots on what could improve someone’s life.</p>
                <p>Cantor & Ball's ambition is to be a dynamic and responsible business. We believe it is important to think about the social and environmental impacts of our business alongside being financially successful. We factor not just economic, but social and ecological thinking into all our business decisions, be it taking on a new client or utilising a new service in house.</p>
                <p>But it’s more than that. We put our profits into turning ideas for social good into sustainable businesses. </p>

                    <p class="bold">Hugo Ball</p>
                    <p>As the author of the first Dada manifesto, Hugo Ball’s influence on us is immense. We value thinking, irreverence, the ridiculous and everyday Dada. Particularly, we strive to never confuse man with machine — nearly a hundred years on from Hugo’s observations on World War 1...</p>
                    <p>‘The war is founded on a glaring mistake, man has been confused with machine.’</p>

                    <p class="bold">Georg Cantor</p>
                    <p>Arguably the inventor of modern mathematics, with his definition of set theory, transfinite arithmetic and much else, we are inspired by the logic and philosophy in Cantor’s approach to problem solving. We believe it's important to think past innate beliefs with a problem, because despite the paradoxes often uncovered, the best solution is not always the obvious one.</p>
