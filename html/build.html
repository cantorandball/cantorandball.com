                <p>Uncertainty — because there’s plenty of gaps and question marks. Sooner or later you’re going to have to write a business plan with some real numbers. Maybe the Board will get it — but what if they don’t? Are you even sure that you want to invest any further in time and people  — and how strong is this idea anyway?</p>
                <p>Ideas for new technology are everywhere. Whether it’s a new mobile app, connected device, web service, api or super spaceship, it’s important to evaluate them carefully and only invest in the next stage once you have the certainty you require to make that business decision.</p>
                <p>It’s easy to waste time and money on ill-formed ideas. And that’s where the Canvas comes in.</p>

                <p>The Canvas is a single day workshop with the core of your team to objectively assess what needs to happen to take your idea to the next level, and ultimately help you decide whether or not you should take it to the next level.</p>

                <p>How much certainty do you need to be able to discover a business case? What assumptions need to be tested and what might you need to do in order to test these assumptions?</p>
                <p>What sort of team will this need? Two people for two weeks? Six people for two days? Or three people for a month? Maybe you need a researcher, a product person, a service designer , a developer— maybe even a psychologist. Ultimately, you need a team appropriate to the uncertainty.</p>

                <p>The purpose of Discovery is to refine an idea down to a solution that can be delivered, and determining whether there is a sustainable business model for it that’s worth pursuing.<p>
                <p>At Cantor & Ball, we’re centred in Tech, focused by systems thinking, and rooted in facts over opinion. Our eye for design helps craft frictionless customer experiences. We’re multi-lingual — we talk tech to business people and we talk business to tech people.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>We can work with you to quantify risks around the idea and provide enough certainty around the problem space. If it does make sense to proceed, we’ll help you define what the right thing is to build and the best way to deliver it.</p>
                <p>Discovery is fluid — it’s a war-room situation. Collaboratively, we’re defining a vision and strategy and deciding on what the jump-off points are. And it starts with a conversation…</p>

                <p>"The team at Cantor & Ball quickly developed an understanding of our business strategy, provided technical expertise to outline an architecture and established an agile development management structure.

                <p>So you know what you need to build. There‘s a clear vision. Your goals and milestones are determined and the constraints are known. But it’s tricky — because there are a bunch of things that work against the successful delivery of a software product or service.</p>

                <p>Whether the requirements aren’t clear, success metrics haven’t been properly identified or simply the idea isn’t ready to be built. Maybe there’s not enough time or money to get it built. Then there’s the bureaucracy: biased estimations, the trade-off between great UX and security, third parties, dependencies, risks, assumptions…</p>

                <p>We’ve experienced these issues (and many more) before, and they’re part of the landscape.</p>
                <p>We prefer openness, sharing, transparency and continuous improvement. Pragmatic at heart, we favour a lean & agile approach, however maintain a healthy scepticism towards methodologies, programming languages, tools and new technologies.</p>

                <p>Instead, we focus on the best solution to the problem at hand. We believe in the power of small, nimble, non-hierarchical, diverse, cross-functional teams to creatively solve problems and happily collaborate with other people or organisations in any configuration.</p>
