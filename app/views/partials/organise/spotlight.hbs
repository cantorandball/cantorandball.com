            <p>Your spider-sense tells you that something’s not right, but you can’t quite pin down what it is. Maybe you’re too close to the problem. Maybe it’s new territory. In any case, you’re looking for some clarity around what you’ve got in place. Ultimately, you need light shed on the problem, so that you can see what to do about it.</p>
            <p>To pinpoint an issue, it must be exposed from different perspectives. The people involved, the processes in place, the desired outcomes.</p>
            <p>At a Spotlight session, we spend a day with the relevant key stakeholders and teams. We look at what are you trying to achieve and how are you trying to achieve it. We look at who’s helping and what activities they’re doing. We clarify risks, issues, constraints, and how well the team outputs are aligned with the overarching business goals.</p>
            <p>Because we’re objective, we will help you see what we see. The outcome is insight and what, if any, improvements can be made.</p>
            <p>Shine a spotlight on your issues…</p>
