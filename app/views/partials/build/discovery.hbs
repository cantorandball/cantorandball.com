            <p>If only there was a machine that would take uncertainty and turn it into certainty. Then, decisions would be relatively straightforward, right?</p>
            <p>How much certainty do you need to be able to discover a business case? What assumptions need to be tested and what might you need to do in order to test these assumptions?</p>
            <p>What sort of team will this need? Two people for two weeks? Six people for two days? Or three people for a month? Maybe you need a researcher, a product person, a service designer, a developer — maybe even a psychologist. Ultimately, you need a team appropriate to the uncertainty.</p>
            <p>The purpose of Discovery is to refine an idea down to a solution that can be delivered, and determining whether there is a sustainable business model for it that’s worth pursuing.</p>

            <p>We can work with you to quantify risks around the idea and provide enough certainty around the problem space. If it does make sense to proceed, we’ll help you define what the right thing is to build and the best way to deliver it.</p>
            <p>Discovery is fluid — it’s a war-room situation. Collaboratively, we’re defining a vision and strategy and deciding on what the jump-off points are.</p>
            <p>It all starts with a conversation, so <a href="index.html#contact">let’s talk…</a></p>
