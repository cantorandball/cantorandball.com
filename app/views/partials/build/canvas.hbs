            <p>So, you’ve had a crackerjack of an idea. Maybe you’ve even got a team together, and you’ve worked through some of the possibilities, and there’s a bit of momentum.</p>
            <p>Uncertainty — because there’s plenty of gaps and question marks. Sooner or later you’re going to have to write a business plan with some real numbers. Maybe the Board will get it — but what if they don’t? Are you even sure that you want to invest any further in time and people  — and how strong is this idea anyway?</p>
            <p>Ideas for new technology are everywhere. Whether it’s a new mobile app, connected device, web service, api or super spaceship, it’s important to evaluate them carefully and only invest in the next stage once you have the certainty you require to make that business decision.</p>
            <p>It’s easy to waste time and money on ill-formed ideas. And that’s where the Canvas comes in.</p>

            <p>The Canvas is a single day workshop with the core of your team to objectively assess what needs to happen to take your idea to the next level, and ultimately help you decide whether or not you should take it to the next level.</p>
            <p>There’s a fine line between genius and insanity. Use the Canvas to determine whether your idea is genius…</p>
