            <p>So you know what you need to build. There‘s a clear vision. Your goals and milestones are determined and the constraints are known. But it’s tricky — because there are a bunch of things that work against the successful delivery of a software product or service.</p>
            <p>Whether the requirements aren’t clear, success metrics haven’t been properly identified or simply the idea isn’t ready to be built. Maybe there’s not enough time or money to get it built. Then there’s the bureaucracy: biased estimations, the trade-off between great UX and security, third parties, dependencies, risks, assumptions…</p>
            <p>We’ve experienced these issues (and many more) before, and they’re part of the landscape.</p>
            <p>We prefer openness, sharing, transparency and continuous improvement. Pragmatic at heart, we favour a lean &amp; agile approach, however maintain a healthy scepticism towards methodologies, programming languages, tools and new technologies.</p>
            <p>Instead, we focus on the best solution to the problem at hand. We believe in the power of small, nimble, non-hierarchical, diverse, cross-functional teams to creatively solve problems and happily collaborate with other people or organisations in any configuration.</p>
            <p>It starts with a conversation...</p>
